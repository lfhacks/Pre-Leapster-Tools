# To-do
- Make a ROM splitter now that the offsets have been figured out
- Document how offsets work on the LeapPad and all related (pre-Leapster) systems
- Document the shape format used by the LeapPad (it uses these for the touch functionality) and make an automated graphics ripper for the iQuest/Turbo Twists
- Figure out where code execution starts and write a disassembler for the Ax51 that the LeapPad (and all similar LeapFrog hardware) used (it isn't a regular 8051! It has some extra instructions and some 16 and 32-Bit functionality.)
